    JUNK
    - the report shows "junk" mileage data - this is data that couldn't be processed
    - it may be the junk sometimes contains proper mileage that you should manually add 
      to the total for that driver
        (eg: "Mileage: 129 (119 mine 10 miles sweeping)" - difficult for the software to process this without specific rules)
    - data is "junked" if :-
        - the length of the post exceeds 100 characters
        - the mileage specified is greater than 500 miles (for that working day)
    - these rules can easily be added, removed or changed
